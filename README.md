#Turing Machine in C++
This project implements a Turing Machine using an object-oriented approach in C++. It's designed to provide a practical and flexible foundation for simulating this fundamental computational model.

##Features
**Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes C++ templates for a generic and reusable codebase.
**Flexible State Management**: Includes a comprehensive state handling mechanism through `TuringStates.h`.
**Dynamic Tape Handling**: Employs `TapeList.h` for an efficient and adaptable tape management system.
**Ease of Use**: Simple and intuitive methods for setting up and running the Turing machine.

##Getting Started
###Prerequisites
  -C++ Compiler
  -Basic understanding of Turing machines and C++ templates

###Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/lunathanael/turing.git
```

###Usage
  1. Include `Turing.h` in your C++ project.
  2. Create a Turing machine instance and configure its state.
  3. Execute the machine and observe the output.


##Code Examples
```
// Example of setting up and running a Turing machine
#include "Turing.h"

int main() {
    // Setup and run your Turing machine here
    return 0;
}
```
##Contributing
Contributions to enhance the functionality or efficiency of the Turing machine are welcome.
